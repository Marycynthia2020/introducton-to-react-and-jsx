<!-- question 5 -->
What are the notable differences between HTML & JSX? Give at least 3 of them

in jsx to rturn multiple elements in a component, they must be wrapped in  a single root, this is not applicable in html
in html we use the keyword class to give classes but in jsx, we make use of className
jsx gives you the ability to create customised tags, unlike in hmtl that has existing tags already

<!-- question 6 -->
Why canâ€™t browsers read JSX?
jsx is not a programming language rather it is a javaScript syntax extension used by react to make html and JS easy to write. hence the browser needs transpilers to be able to translate it to a valid JS syntax.
